# "NYC CitiBike" Week 14 Challenge
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal that will encourage investors to support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Visualizations were created to see average biking duration trends and analyze the customer base, specifically to show:
1. Show the length of time that bikes were checked out for all riders and genders,
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
Based off of the analysis, we can infer that many of these users throughout the weekdays will be work commuters while the weekends can consistent of a balance of  city residents and tourists. Additionally, a majority of the users were male riders. Although this may not be anything significant, but it's useful for future marketing campaigns. Another significant point that can be made is that most of the ride durations peaked at around 5 minutes. If there were to be a bike-sharing program set up in Des Moines, it would help if each station can be set up within no more than 20 minutes of biking distance from each other. This is because we need to take into account that Manhattan is a large city, where Des Moines is made up of suburbs; places tend to be farther apart in suburbs compared to places in large cities, but they shouldn't be too far apart to disincentivize using the service.
